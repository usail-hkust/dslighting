Develop a model that captures the flow of play as points occur and apply it to one or more of the matches. Your model should identify which player is performing better at a given time in the match, as well as how much better they are performing. Provide a visualization based on your model to depict the match flow. Note: in tennis, the player serving has a much higher probability of winning the point/game. You may wish to factor this into your model in some way.
