# plot-line-016

Please follow the instructions in README.md to plot a timeline line chart for Markdown1-5, showing the trend of promotions over time. Format the chart according to plot.yaml and save the resulting image as the required rendered plot artifact

## Output Requirements

Your final output must be a submission directory.

The exact directory name will be provided at runtime in the CRITICAL I/O REQUIREMENTS section.

Inside that directory, you must create exactly these three files:

- rendered plot image artifact
- structured plot metadata JSON artifact
- numeric payload artifact extracted from the figure

## Dataset Background

## About Dataset

### Context
The Challenge - One challenge of modeling retail data is the need to make decisions based on limited history. Holidays and select major events come once a year, and so does the chance to see how strategic decisions impacted the bottom line. In addition, markdowns are known to affect sales – the challenge is to predict which departments will be affected and to what extent.** **

### Content
You are provided with historical sales data for 45 stores located in different regions - each store contains a number of departments. The company also runs several promotional markdown events throughout the year. These markdowns precede prominent holidays, the four largest of which are the Super Bowl, Labor Day, Thanksgiving, and Christmas. The weeks including these holidays are weighted five times higher in the evaluation than non-holiday weeks.

Within the Excel Sheet, there are 3 Tabs – Stores, Features and Sales** **

### Stores

Anonymized information about the 45 stores, indicating the type and size of store

### Features

Contains additional data related to the store, department, and regional activity for the given dates.** **

* Store - the store number
* Date - the week
* Temperature - average temperature in the region
* Fuel_Price - cost of fuel in the region
* MarkDown1-5 - anonymized data related to promotional markdowns. MarkDown data is only available after Nov 2011, and is not available for all stores all the time. Any missing value is marked with an NA
* CPI - the consumer price index
* Unemployment - the unemployment rate
* IsHoliday - whether the week is a special holiday week

### Sales

Historical sales data, which covers to 2010-02-05 to 2012-11-01. Within this tab you will find the following fields:

* Store - the store number
* Dept - the department number
* Date - the week
* Weekly_Sales -  sales for the given department in the given store
* IsHoliday - whether the week is a special holiday week

## Chart Format Specification

The following formatting requirements are specified in `plot.yaml` (the file is available in your workspace):

```yaml
figsize: [15.0, 4.0]
graph_title: "Timeline Markdown"
x_title: "Date", 
y_title: "Markdown"
colors: ["#9467bd", "#d62728", "#ff7f0e", "#1f77b4", "#2ca02c"]
```

Your chart output **must** match these values exactly.

## Output File Format Details

### Metadata JSON — Required Keys

The metadata JSON artifact MUST use **exactly** these keys (the same schema as the sample metadata file in your workspace):

```json
{
  "type":         "<chart type: bar | line | pie | scatter>",
  "color":        ["<hex color per bar/slice/line, e.g. "#1f77b4">"],
  "figsize":      [<width_float>, <height_float>],
  "graph_title":  "<plot title string>",
  "legend_title": "<legend title or empty string "">",
  "labels":       ["<series labels — often empty list []>"],
  "x_label":      "<x-axis label string>",
  "y_label":      "<y-axis label string>",
  "xtick_labels": ["<x-axis tick labels as strings>"],
  "ytick_labels": ["<y-axis tick labels as strings>"]
}
```

Extract these values directly from your matplotlib figure **after** rendering:

```python
import matplotlib
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
import json, numpy as np

fig, ax = plt.subplots(figsize=(...))
# --- your plotting code here ---
fig.savefig("<rendered_plot_artifact_path>")

# Extract plot metadata
plot_meta = {
    "type": "bar",          # set to: bar | line | pie | scatter
    "color": [
        matplotlib.colors.to_hex(p.get_facecolor())
        for p in ax.patches  # use ax.lines / ax.collections for line/scatter
    ],
    "figsize":      list(fig.get_size_inches()),
    "graph_title":  ax.get_title(),
    "legend_title": (
        ax.get_legend().get_title().get_text()
        if ax.get_legend() else ""
    ),
    "labels":       [],
    "x_label":      ax.get_xlabel(),
    "y_label":      ax.get_ylabel(),
    "xtick_labels": [t.get_text() for t in ax.get_xticklabels()],
    "ytick_labels": [t.get_text() for t in ax.get_yticklabels()],
}
with open("<metadata_json_artifact_path>", "w") as f:
    json.dump(plot_meta, f)
```

### Numeric Payload — Required Shape

Save the **primary numeric data** of the plot (bar heights, line y-values, pie sizes, scatter y-values) as a **2D array with shape `(1, N)`**, where N = number of data points:

```python
np.save("<numeric_payload_artifact_path>", data_values.reshape(1, -1))
```
