Task Goal and Data Overview: # Bike Sharing Demand

## Description

Bike sharing systems are a means of renting bicycles where the process of obtaining membership, rental, and bike return is automated via a network of kiosk locations throughout a city. Using these systems, people are able to rent a bike from one location and return it to a different place on an as-needed basis. Currently, there are over 500 bike-sharing programs around the world.

The data generated by these systems makes them attractive for researchers because the duration of travel, departure location, arrival location, and time elapsed are explicitly recorded. Bike sharing systems therefore function as a sensor network, which can be used for studying mobility in a city. In this competition, participants are asked to combine historical usage patterns with weather data in order to forecast bike rental demand in the Capital Bikeshare program in Washington, D.C.

## Evaluation

Submissions are evaluated on the Root Mean Squared Logarithmic Error (RMSLE). The RMSLE is calculated as:

$$\sqrt{\frac{1}{n} \sum_{i=1}^n (\log(p_i + 1) - \log(a_i + 1))^2}$$

Where:
- n is the number of hours in the test set
- p_i is your predicted count
- a_i is the actual count
- log(x) is the natural logarithm

## Submission Format

Your submission file must have a header and should be structured in the following format:

```
datetime,count
2011-01-20 00:00:00,0
2011-01-20 01:00:00,0
2011-01-20 02:00:00,0
...
```

## Dataset Description

You are provided hourly rental data spanning two years. For this competition, the training set is comprised of the first 19 days of each month, while the test set is the 20th to the end of the month. You must predict the total count of bikes rented during each hour covered by the test set, using only information available prior to the rental period.

## Data Fields

- `datetime`: hourly date + timestamp
- `season`: 1 = spring, 2 = summer, 3 = fall, 4 = winter
- `holiday`: whether the day is considered a holiday
- `workingday`: whether the day is neither a weekend nor holiday
- `weather`:
  - 1: Clear, Few clouds, Partly cloudy
  - 2: Mist + Cloudy, Mist + Broken clouds, Mist + Few clouds, Mist
  - 3: Light Snow, Light Rain + Thunderstorm + Scattered clouds, Light Rain + Scattered clouds
  - 4: Heavy Rain + Ice Pallets + Thunderstorm + Mist, Snow + Fog
- `temp`: temperature in Celsius
- `atemp`: "feels like" temperature in Celsius
- `humidity`: relative humidity
- `windspeed`: wind speed
- `casual`: number of non-registered user rentals initiated (only in training set)
- `registered`: number of registered user rentals initiated (only in training set)
- `count`: number of total rentals (only in training set)

## Submission Format Requirements

**CRITICAL:** Your final submission file MUST EXACTLY match the format of the sample submission file provided (`sampleSubmission.csv`).
This includes the column names, column order, and data types. Failure to adhere to this format will result in a score of zero.


**Required Submission Columns:**
Your submission file MUST contain the following columns in this exact order:
```
['datetime', 'count']
```
This is a strict requirement for the submission to be graded correctly. The grading system uses the non-prediction columns (like 'Comment' or an 'id') to match your predictions against the ground truth.


**Format Details:**
*First 5 rows:*
```text
           datetime  count
2011-07-19 11:00:00      0
2012-01-16 06:00:00      0
2011-12-11 18:00:00      0
2012-08-15 10:00:00      0
2012-06-15 23:00:00      0
```

*Data types:*
```text
datetime    object
count        int64
```




CRITICAL I/O REQUIREMENTS (MUST BE FOLLOWED): 
--- CRITICAL I/O REQUIREMENTS ---

You MUST follow these file system rules precisely. Failure to do so will cause a fatal error.

1. **INPUT DATA:**
   - All input files are located in the **current working directory** (./).
   - Example: Use `pd.read_csv('train.csv')`.

2. **OUTPUT FILE:**
   - You MUST save your final submission file to the **current working directory** (./).
   - The required output filename is: `submission_bike-sharing-demand_abe7b8.csv`
   - **Correct Example:** `submission_df.to_csv('submission_bike-sharing-demand_abe7b8.csv', index=False)`


**IMPORTANT:** These path requirements are non-negotiable and must be followed exactly.

Memory of Past Attempts: No successful solutions have been found yet.
Retrieved Knowledge: No relevant knowledge was retrieved for this task.
Instructions:
  Goal: Propose a simple but effective plan and implement it in Python.
  Design Guideline: Your first solution should be straightforward and robust. Focus on correctly addressing the core requirements based on the data report AND the CRITICAL I/O REQUIREMENTS.
  Response Format: Your response MUST start with a brief natural language plan (3-5 sentences), followed by a single, complete Python code block wrapped in ```python ... ```. Do not include any other text or headings.
  Implementation Guidelines:
    - The code must be a self-contained, single-file Python script.
    - If the task involves modeling or optimization, print key metrics (e.g., validation scores) to standard output. Otherwise, ensure the output clearly presents the findings or results.
    - Follow the CRITICAL I/O REQUIREMENTS provided in the task description precisely for all file operations.
    - Do not use interactive elements like `input()` or `matplotlib.pyplot.show()`.
